            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Howdy! My name is Ren Gernes and I'm a senior majoring in math and computer science.
                    I'll be graduating in the spring of this year, so I'm currently looking for a job
                    in software engineering that I could start at after the summer. I'm thinking I might 
                    also start looking for an internship this summer to increase my chances of getting hired.
                    I'm really looking forward to this class, since it'll give me a good sense of
                    what working on a software project with a team is like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm the youngest out of all my siblings. My brother, Adam, and sister, Meghan,
                    both live in Texas. Adam is two years older and has been working at Capital One 
                    as a software engineer since he graduated. His long time girlfriend, Grace, currently 
                    has an internship in Florida working with avian ecology. Meghan is 14 years older than
                    me and has been married for almost a decade now. She also has a daughter named Taylor
                    who's absolutely adorable and is obsessed with dinosaurs. My parents and I usually go down 
                    to vist my siblings a couple times a year and it's always fun getting to see everyone again.

            <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How develop a SaaS application and set up a server for it with Azure
                    <li>How to effectively and efficiently work in a Scrum team
                    <li>How to write more advanced HTML and JavaScript code
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
            <p>
                In my free time, I like to crochet. A few years back, Grace crocheted me a whale 
                as a gift for getting my wisdom teeth out. I loved it so much that I wanted to learn
                how to make my own animals. After practicing different stitches by watching Youtube 
                tutorials, I started on my first project. I made a little stuffed whale keychain to put
                on my lanyard with my key and ID. It was a little rough, but it made me proud. From there, 
                I crocheted stuffed animals for all my close friends. I think the most satisfying part of
                crocheting is seeing my friends' smile when they receive the finished product.
            </p>

                <li><a href="https://www.itu.int/newsarchive/wtd/2001/ExecutiveSummary.html" target="blank">Internet</a> because it allows everyone to be connected through their devices
